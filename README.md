My personal profile

Hello!

My name is Connie.
Fun fact: My parents named me after the great state of Connecticut. That's where the first half of my name comes from (Con).
The second half (nie) is the English translation of the Chinese word for girl.

I was born on Thanksgiving day in 2000 and have lived in Connecticut since.

The Office and Gilmore Girls define me.

Favorite word: eureka!
