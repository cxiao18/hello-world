My personal profile


Hi! My name is Connie Xiao.
My name, itself, is actually an odd story.
My parents immigrated to the US before I was born and settled down in small-town Connecticut. 
When I came around, they decided to name me after the wonderful state that they now called home.
So 'Con' comes from Connecticut and 'nie' is the closest English translation of the word girl in Chinese.
That's all. 

Hello!

My name is Connie.
Fun fact: My parents named me after the great state of Connecticut. That's where the first half of my name comes from (Con).
The second half (nie) is the English translation of the Chinese word for girl.

I was born on Thanksgiving day in 2000 and have lived in Connecticut since.

The Office and Gilmore Girls define me.

Favorite word: eureka!
