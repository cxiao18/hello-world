My personal profile


Hi! My name is Connie Xiao.
My name, itself, is actually an odd story.
My parents immigrated to the US before I was born and settled down in small-town Connecticut. 
When I came around, they decided to name me after the wonderful state that they now called home.
So 'Con' comes from Connecticut and 'nie' is the closest English translation of the word girl in Chinese.
That's all. 


Also, my favorite word is eureka.
